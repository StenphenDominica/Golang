1. Examples
    Go 包的源码不仅是核心库，同时也是学习如何使用 Go 语言的示例代码。
    The Go package sources are intended to serve not only as the core library but also as examples of how to use the language.

2. Formatting
   Formatting issues are the most contentious but the least consequential.
   All Go code in the standard packages has been formated with **gofmt**.
   Some formatting details remain, Very briefly:
   ## Indentation
    We use tabs for indetation and gofmt emits them by default. Use spaces if you must.
   ## Line length 
    Go has no line lenth limit.
   ## Parentheses
    Go needs fewer parentheses than C and Java;

3. Commentary 
   1. Go provides C-style /* */ block comments and C++-style // comments. Line comments are the norm, block comments appear mostly as package comments.
   2. Every package should have a package  comment, a block comment preceding the package clause. For multi-file package, the package comment only needs to be present in one file, and anyone will do.
